In this project, we are tasked with uploading a CSV file containing a column with semi-structured JSON data into a Snowflake table.
After the CSV is uploaded, the goal is to extract and flatten the semi-structured JSON data stored in the specified column and use it to create a view with a structured format. This view will allow for easier querying and analysis of the JSON data in Snowflake.

Requirements
CSV Upload to Snowflake:

The CSV file contains a column with semi-structured JSON data along with other structured columns.
Upload the CSV file into a Snowflake table using appropriate methods such as Snowflake's COPY command or through an ETL tool.
Extracting JSON Data:

Extract the semi-structured JSON data from the designated column.
Use Snowflake's built-in JSON functions (e.g., FLATTEN, :, OBJECT_VALUE, etc.) to parse and extract the necessary fields from the JSON data.
Creating a Structured View:

Create a view that flattens the JSON data into structured columns, making it easier to query and analyze.
Ensure the view represents both the JSON data and any relevant structured data from the CSV file.
